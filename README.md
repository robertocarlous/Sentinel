# 🛡️ Sentinel: AI-Powered DeFi Guardian  

## 🚀 Executive Summary  

### 🎯 What Are We Building?  
Sentinel is an **AI-powered guardian** that protects DeFi users from losing money to hacks and exploits by automatically detecting threats and withdrawing funds to safety before losses occur.  

### 💡 The Big Idea (30-Second Pitch)  
> "DeFi users lost **$3.7 billion** to hacks last year. Sentinel is an **autonomous AI agent** that monitors your DeFi positions 24/7 and automatically protects your funds when exploits are detected – faster than any human could react."  

### 🏆 Why This Will Win  
- Solves a **HUGE problem**: Billions lost annually to DeFi exploits  
- **No competition**: No autonomous protection solutions exist yet  
- **Dramatic demo**: Watch Sentinel save money in real-time  
- **Perfect for Somnia**: Leverages high-performance blockchain for instant execution  
- **Clear value**: “You saved $X” metric sticks with judges  

✅ **Success = Top 3 in DeFi Track**  
We win if judges see:  
- Working autonomous threat detection  
- Emergency withdrawal in <30 seconds  
- Clear demonstration of money saved  
- Professional execution and polish

## 📉 The Problem We're Solving  

### 💸 The Numbers Tell the Story  
| Statistic      | Impact                             |  
|----------------|------------------------------------|  
| $3.7 billion   | Lost to DeFi hacks in 2024         |  
| $7.5 million   | Average exploit size               |  
| $12,000        | Median user loss per exploit       |  
| 68%            | DeFi users who’ve lost money       |  

### 😰 User Pain Points  
1. **Constant Fear** – Users can’t sleep, constantly checking positions.  
2. **Can’t React Fast Enough** – Exploits complete before manual withdrawals.  
3. **Existing Solutions Don’t Work** –  
   - Manual monitoring → not 24/7  
   - Alert systems → notify but don’t act  
   - Audits → pre-deployment only  
   - Insurance → pays after loss (if approved)  
   - Stop-loss → only handles price drops  

### ⚡ Why Now?  
- DeFi growing **40% yearly** → more money at risk  
- Exploits getting more sophisticated  
- Somnia’s **speed enables real-time defense**  
- AI agents = **hot narrative** in Web3
